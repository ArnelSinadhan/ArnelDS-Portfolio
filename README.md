# Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website showcasing my skills, projects, and experiences. The website is built using Vite with React, and it includes interactive effects with Particle.js and email functionality using EmailJS.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The website is fully responsive and works seamlessly across all devices, from desktop to mobile.
- **Modern UI:** Built with React and styled with Bootstrap for a clean and modern user interface.
- **Interactive Background:** Particle.js is used to create an engaging particle background effect.
- **Email Integration:** EmailJS is integrated to allow visitors to contact me directly through a form on the website.

## Demo

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The website will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production

To build the project for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be available in the `dist` directory.

## Usage

### Particle.js

Particle.js is used to create a dynamic background effect. The configuration for the particles can be found in the `src/particlesConfig.js` file. You can adjust the particle count, color, and other settings to customize the appearance.

### EmailJS

EmailJS is integrated to send emails directly from the website. To use this feature:

1. Create an account on [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/).
2. Create a service and a template on the EmailJS dashboard.
3. Copy your Service ID, Template ID, and Public Key.
4. Replace the placeholder values in the `src/components/AppNavbar.jsx` with your EmailJS credentials:

   ```javascript
   const SERVICE_ID = "your_service_id";
   const TEMPLATE_ID = "your_template_id";
   const PUBLIC_KEY = "your_public_key";
   ```

5. The contact form in the `AppNavbar.jsx` component will now send emails using EmailJS.
